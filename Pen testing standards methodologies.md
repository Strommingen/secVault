## Mitre Att&ck
Framework.
Collection of different matrices of tactics techniques and sub techniques. 
including Enterprise ATTA&CK matrix, network, cloud, ICS and mobile-list the tactics and techniques that adversaries use while prepping for an attack. OSINT (open source intelligence) also.
Good for learning for offensive security professionals and incident responders and threat hunting teams.
Has **Gather Victim Identity Information** info section in **Reconnaissance** section with three subsections:
1. Techniques for gathering credentials 
2. Email addresses 
3. Employee names.
## OWASP WSTG
Guide focused on web app testing.
Covers high level phases of web app security testing and digs deeper into the testing methods used.
Provides attack vectors for testing cross-site scripting (XSS), XML external entity (XXE) attacks, cross site request forgery (CSRF) and SQL injection attacks. And how to prevent and mitigate these attacks.
Twelve active tests defined
1. Information gathering  
2. Configuration and deployment management testing  
3. Identity management testing  
4. Authentication testing  
5. Authorization testing  
6. Session management testing  
7. Input validation testing  
8. Error Handling  
9. Cryptography  
10. Business logic testing  
11. Client-side testing  
12. API testing

## NIST SP 800-115
Document from National institute of standards and technology (NIST). Part of US dep. of commerce.
Provides organizations guidelines on planning and conducting information security testing. 
Industry standard for pen testing guidance.

## OSSTMM

- Compliance Regulations
- Reporting with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR)

## PTES
Penetration Testing Execution Standard.
Information on latest tools available to accomplish the following testing methods.
1. Pre-engagement interactions
2. Intelligence gathering
3. Threat modeling
4. Vulnerability analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-exploitation
7. Reporting
## ISSAF
Information Systems security assessment framework.
Another pen testing methodology similar to others in this document with some additions. It covers the following:
- Information gathering
- Network mapping
- Vulnerability identification
- Penetration
- Gaining access and privilege escalation
- Enumerating further
- Compromising remote users/sites
- Maintaining access
- Covering the tracks
